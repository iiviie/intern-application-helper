# Human-Like Writing: What Makes Text Sound Natural

## 🎯 The 15 Patterns That Make Writing Sound Human

This guide documents the patterns we've implemented to make AI-generated content indistinguishable from human writing.

---

## 1. **Natural Conversational Flow**

❌ **AI-like (symmetric, uniform):**
> I have been working as a software engineer for two years. I have experience with Python and FastAPI. I have built several applications that demonstrate my skills.

✅ **Human-like (varied rhythm):**
> I've been working as a backend developer for a little over two years now. Built a few projects with Python and FastAPI - one recently handled a pretty big jump in requests. No small feat.

**Why it works:** Sentences vary in length. Short. Medium length. Some that flow with multiple clauses and keep going with additional thoughts.

---

## 2. **Informal but Confident Tone**

❌ **AI-like:**
> This position appears extremely interesting to me and aligns perfectly with my career objectives.

✅ **Human-like:**
> This really excites me - it's super impressive what you're building.

**Words that sound human:**
- "super impressive"
- "really excites me"
- "quite a bit"
- "no small feat"
- "pretty cool"
- "a little over [time]"

---

## 3. **Use of Contractions**

❌ **AI-like (no contractions):**
> I have been following your company. I would love to discuss this opportunity. It is impressive.

✅ **Human-like (natural contractions):**
> I've been following your company. I'd love to discuss this. It's impressive.

**Must use:** I've, it's, couldn't, I'd, there's, you're, they're, we're, don't, can't, won't

---

## 4. **Minor Imperfections and Relaxed Phrasing**

❌ **AI-like (precise):**
> I have exactly two years and three months of experience.

✅ **Human-like (naturally imprecise):**
> Been working with this for a little over two years now.

**Natural hedging words:**
- "around"
- "about"
- "quite"
- "pretty"
- "a bit"
- "probably"
- "seems like"

---

## 5. **Varied Sentence Length and Rhythm**

❌ **AI-like (uniform):**
> I am a software engineer with two years of experience. I have worked on multiple projects. I am skilled in Python and JavaScript. I am eager to contribute to your team.

✅ **Human-like (varied):**
> I'm a software engineer. Been at it for about two years, working mostly with Python and JavaScript on projects that actually got shipped. I'd love to contribute.

---

## 6. **Specific but Not Exaggerated Detail**

❌ **AI-like (abstract buzzwords):**
> Developed robust, scalable, high-performance microservices architecture leveraging cutting-edge technologies.

✅ **Human-like (concrete, lived experience):**
> Built a FastAPI setup that handled a pretty big jump in requests - went from maybe 100/sec to around 10k. Turned out pretty well.

---

## 7. **Colloquial Connectors and Transitions**

❌ **AI-like:**
> Additionally, I have experience with databases. Moreover, I am proficient in API design. Furthermore, I excel at problem-solving.

✅ **Human-like:**
> Recently built out a database layer. I'd say I'm pretty solid with API design at this point. Been debugging production issues for a while now.

**Use these:**
- "Recently"
- "I'd love to"
- "Any chance we could"
- "Been following"
- "Turned out"

**Avoid these:**
- "Additionally"
- "Moreover"
- "Furthermore"
- "In conclusion"
- "Therefore"

---

## 8. **Authentic Emotional Expression**

❌ **AI-like:**
> I am extremely passionate and deeply enthusiastic about this opportunity.

✅ **Human-like:**
> This really excites me. What you're building is super impressive.

---

## 9. **Minimal Overuse of Buzzwords**

❌ **AI-like:**
> Leveraged robust, innovative, cutting-edge solutions to deliver end-to-end scalable architecture using best-in-class technologies.

✅ **Human-like:**
> Built a system that could handle the load. Used Python and FastAPI because they worked well for what we needed.

**Banned buzzwords:**
- robust
- innovative
- cutting-edge
- end-to-end
- scalable solutions
- leverage/leveraging
- best-in-class
- synergy
- paradigm

---

## 10. **Direct Address and Personal Engagement**

❌ **AI-like:**
> Dear Hiring Manager,
> I am writing to express my sincere interest in the Software Engineer position at your esteemed organization.

✅ **Human-like:**
> Hey Sarah,
> Been following what you're building at Acme - the way you're handling real-time data is really cool.

**Openings:**
- "Hey [name],"
- "Hi [name],"
- Just "[Name],"

**Closings:**
- "Any chance we could hop on a quick call?"
- "Would love to chat about this"
- "Thanks!"
- "Cheers,"

**Avoid:**
- "Dear [title]"
- "Looking forward to hearing from you"
- "Sincerely,"
- "Best regards,"

---

## 11. **Natural Punctuation Patterns**

❌ **AI-like:**
> I have experience with Python; FastAPI; and Docker.

✅ **Human-like:**
> I've worked with Python, FastAPI, Docker - the usual backend stack.

**Use dashes for casual asides:**
- "Built this thing - turned out pretty well"
- "Been working on APIs for a while now - mostly REST, some GraphQL"

---

## 12. **Lack of Symmetrical Phrasing**

❌ **AI-like (perfectly balanced):**
> I have experience with frontend development and backend development. I am skilled in design and implementation. I excel at planning and execution.

✅ **Human-like (asymmetrical):**
> I've done some frontend work, but mostly I'm a backend person. Built stuff, shipped it, debugged it when it broke.

---

## 13. **Contextual Alignment of Tone and Content**

Match the situation:
- **Cold email**: Casual but professional
- **DM**: Very casual, friendly
- **Cover letter**: Professional but natural

Never sound too formal for a casual medium or too casual for a formal one.

---

## 14. **Personal Ownership and Reflection**

❌ **AI-like:**
> Successfully implemented a microservices architecture that improved performance by 40%.

✅ **Human-like:**
> I've been working on splitting up our monolith into services. It's improved things quite a bit - maybe 40% faster? Been a good learning experience.

**Show ownership:**
- "I've been working on"
- "I built"
- "I'd love to learn more"

---

## 15. **Implied Spontaneity**

❌ **AI-like (over-edited):**
> Upon careful consideration of your organization's mission, vision, and strategic objectives, I have determined that my skills and experience align exceptionally well with your requirements.

✅ **Human-like (thought through once):**
> Looked at what you're building - seems like a really good fit for what I've been working on. Would love to chat.

## 🎯 Implementation in Our System

All these patterns are now built into the AI prompts:

1. **Mandatory contractions** - System explicitly requires using them
2. **Banned phrases** - AI is told never to use formal clichés
3. **Varied rhythm** - Instructions to alternate short and long sentences
4. **Natural imprecision** - Encouraged to use "about," "around," "quite"
5. **Casual confidence** - Use words like "super impressive," "really excites me"
6. **Direct examples** - "Built X that did Y" not "I have experience with"
7. **Natural closings** - "Any chance we could chat?" not "Looking forward"

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Content

Ask yourself:

1. ✅ Does it use contractions? (I've, it's, I'd)
2. ✅ Are sentences different lengths?
3. ✅ Does it sound like you're talking to someone?
4. ✅ Would you actually send this?
5. ✅ Are there specific examples, not abstract skills?
6. ✅ Is the tone casual but professional?
7. ❌ Does it have buzzwords? (robust, innovative, leverage)
8. ❌ Does it start with "I am writing to..."?
9. ❌ Does it end with "Looking forward to..."?
10. ❌ Are all sentences the same length?

If you fail any ❌ test, it sounds AI-generated.

## 💡 Final Tip

**The best way to sound human: Write it like you'd actually say it out loud to someone you respect but know casually.**

If you wouldn't say "I am passionate about leveraging" to a senior engineer you met at a conference, don't write it in an email.
